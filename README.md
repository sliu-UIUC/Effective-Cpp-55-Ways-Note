# *Effective C++:  55 Ways to improve your programs and designs* Note (In Progress)
This is a repository for notes I took when reading the book ***Effective C++ Third Edition: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*** by Scott Meyers. The note contains of what are the important takeaways from the book. Note that this is not a redistribution of the content of the book, just some note I took for me to learn more about C++ programming language and design, and it would be a more convenient way to check for some coding decorum. Hopefully this can also help others who wish to improve their design of C++ programs.

### List of Effective C++ techniques: 
1. [View C++ as a federation of languages](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item1.md)
2. [Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item2.md)
3. [Use const whenever possible](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item3.md)
4. [Make sure objects are initialized before used](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item4.md)
