# *Effective C++:  55 Ways to improve your programs and designs* Note (In Progress)
This is a repository for notes I took when reading the book ***Effective C++ Third Edition: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*** by Scott Meyers. The note contains of what are the important concepts and examples from the book. Note that this is not a redistribution of the content of the book, just some note I took for me to learn more about C++ programming language and design, and it would be a more convenient way to check for some coding decorum. Instead, I strongly recommend every C++ programmers to purchase this book and read it through, and check back here for concepts rewind. Hopefully this can also help others who wish to improve their design of C++ programs.

## Chapter 1:  Basics
1. [View C++ as a federation of languages](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item1.md)
2. [Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item2.md)
3. [Use const whenever possible](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item3.md)
4. [Make sure objects are initialized before used](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item4.md)

## Chapter 2: Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment Operators 

5.  [Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item5.md)
6.  [Explicitly disallow the use of compiler-generated functions you do not want](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item6.md)
7.  [Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item7.md)
8.  [Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item8.md)
9.  [Never call virtual functions during construction or destruction](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item9.md)
10. [Have assignment operators return a reference to `*this`](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item10.md)
11. [Handling assignment to self in `operator=`](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item11.md)
12. [Copy all parts of an object](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item12.md)


## Chapter 3: Resource Management

13.  [Use objects to manage resources](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/Effective-Cpp-55-Ways-Note/blob/master/item13.md)
